# Event Management System

The Event Management System is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline the process of organizing and managing events

This system empowers users with the ability to create distinct categories, facilitating organized grouping of events based on common themes or purposes. Within each category, users can seamlessly create events with essential attributes such as name, start date, end date, location, organizer, and description. The inclusion of priority levels for events allows for easy identification and prioritization, ensuring important events receive due attention.

The system offers views for creating, updating, and deleting categories and events, facilitating effortless management of event-related data. Additionally, users can visualize pending events for each category through an interactive chart, providing valuable insights into event distribution and workload across different categories.

To enhance user experience and streamline operations, the system leverages Chart.js for dynamic chart generation, enabling users to visualize pending events at a glance
